Mini-Weather
=============
This is my course project a year ago and it implements on Android Studio.<br>
It is an APP which only implements the function of displaying the weather information of different cities, so it's not very well.<br>

**PS: I'm not update this repository now, so I can't ensure the codes can run in your computer. Sorry!**
